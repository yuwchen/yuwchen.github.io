### Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Selecting the optimal location for a new bank branch is challenging but worth studying due to its importance to the success of the business. 
In recent years, the proliferation of multisource data in smart cities has promoted the development of the data-driven methods on this issue. 
Previous studies have been devoting lots of effort; however, they usually focus on mining different features and process these data through domain expert knowledge.
Therefore, they fail to discover potential complicated factors interactions. Besides, most of these studies only use a single indicator to evaluate the candidate locations, which overlooks a lot of information, resulting in an inaccurate evaluation.
In this study, we propose MATE, a Multi-task Attentive Tree-Enhanced model. With the financial embedding module and attentive interaction block, MATE learns the interactions of cross features and can simultaneously predict multiple performance indicators of a bank branchâ€™s location.
In addition, MATE takes advantage of the tree-based model, which can effectively extract cross features and provide interpretability according to inferred decision rules. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world bank branches datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MATE, which outperforms baseline and state-of-art methods from 17% to 41%.

### Motivation
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This study focues on the development of a location prediction system. With such system, the president of the bank can not only pre-estimate the effectiveness of arbitrary locations to avoid building branches with poor performance but also help the bank branch become profitable in the near future.

### The Proposed Multi-task Attentive Tree-Enhanced model (MATE)

First, MATE provides the predictions of various indicators, which are more in line with bankers' actual needs and can help them make a more comprehensive decision. In addition, MATE uses a negative sampling strategy to solve the data imbalance problem. Therefore, it can accurately and effectively predict the performance of every location in the city. Moreover, because MATE combines the effectiveness of the GBDT model and attention mechanisms, it has excellent interpretability. Therefore, the predictions of MATE are more convincing and thus more useful in assisting decision-making. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed MATE outperforms the state-of-the-art models in all tasks. Notably, MATE has been used for assisting the banker to deploy optimal branch locations in several cities in Taiwan in 2020.
