### Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In this study, we present a deep learning-based speech signal-processing mobile application, known as CITISEN, which can perform three functions: speech enhancement (SE), model adaptation (MA), and background noise conversion (BNC). 
For SE, CITISEN can effectively reduce noise components from speech signals and accordingly enhance their clarity and intelligibility. When it encounters noisy utterances with unknown speakers or noise types, the MA function allows CITISEN to effectively improve the SE performance by adapting an SE model with a few audio files. 
Finally, for the BNC, CITISEN converts the current background noise to different background noise. The novel BNC function can evaluate SE performance under specific conditions, cover up peopleâ€™s tracks, and provide entertainment. 
The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of performing SE, MA, and BNC functions through objective evaluation and subjective listening tests. The promising results revealed that the developed CITISEN mobile application can be potentially used as a front-end processor for various speech-related services, such as voice communication, assistive hearing devices, and virtual reality headsets.
In addition, CITISEN can be used as a platform for utilizing and evaluating state-of-the-art deep-learning-SE models, and can flexibly extend the models to address various noise environments and users. Finally, the proposed BNC function can be used not only in CITISEN, but also for data augmentation and to promote the development of an acoustic scene classification model.
