Hello! I am Yu-Wen Chen.<br />
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I currently work as a research assistant in <a href="https://bio-asplab.citi.sinica.edu.tw/">Bio-ASP Lab</a>, Academia Sinica, where I am conducting research with Professor <a href="https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/yu.tsao/index_en.html">Yu Tsao</a>.
Before joining Bio-ASP Lab, I earned my master’s degree at National Taiwan University (NTU) under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=901166">Tian-Li Yu</a>. Prior to NTU, I received B.S. in EE from National Cheng Kung University. <br />
<br />
My primary research interests lie in the area of speech processing, multimodal learning, human-computer interaction, and machine learning. My long-term goal of research is to build a system that can make human life more convenient and productive.
